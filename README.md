# Initial
> #### *A single-page Drupal 7 theme.*

*Initial* began as a way to understand Drupal theming by minimizing what was output by the theme's templates. This approach was inspired by and drew heavily on [this now defunct](http://web.archive.org/web/20130203055201/http://jamesbillings.me/labs/item/drupal-template-minimizing) article by James Billings.
